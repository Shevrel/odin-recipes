        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nothing beats a lovely soup!</p>
        <p>A Ramen is nothing less than a healthy and comfy meal.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tsp freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>4 cups Chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>2-3 oz portions of Ramen</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a medium-large saucepan over moderate heat (see notes).
                Add garlic and ginger, and simmer until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Do not brown the garlic, or else you'll get a bitter flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the carrots and mushrooms if you're using them, and simmer until they soften, about a minute, stirring frequently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the broth, Sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir, and bring to a simmer; let it go for about five minutes.
                Taste, and adjust heat and taste to your liking by adding more Sriracha and soy sauce if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the broth simmers, cook the Ramen noodles in a separate pot as per the package's instructions.
                (You could cook the noodles in the broth directly, but that makes for a messy transfer to a bowl.
                It's much easier to transfer drained cooked noodles to a bowl and spoon the broth over top.)
                Once the noodles are tender, drain and rinse under cool water, place into a soup bowl, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the soup is ready, spoon the broth over the noodles. Allow to cool. At this point, make your soft-boiled egg if you're garnishing with one,
                and add the rest of your toppings to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
